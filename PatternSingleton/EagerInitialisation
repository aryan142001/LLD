    Eager Initialization:

    Pros:
        Simple and straightforward.
        Thread-safe as the instance is created at the time of class loading.

    Cons:
        The instance is created even if it is not used, which may lead to unnecessary resource consumption.
        Does not support lazy loading.

    java

public class SingletonEager {
    private static final SingletonEager instance = new SingletonEager();

    private SingletonEager() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static SingletonEager getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
