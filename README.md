# LLD
Some design patterns and knowledge about LLD
* While applying OO principles the overall purpose should be served. For example, one using 
  inheritance for the purpose of **reuse** should also look for **maintenance**.[For a new feature exiting features 
  should not be hindered]
* For example, we need a new feature of flying ducks but existing features should not be hindered. Some ducks can fly not all
* Disadvantages of Inheritance:-
  * _Tightly coupled_ > One cannot be used independent of each other
  * During _maintenance_ , adding new features both base as well as derived classes needs to be changed
