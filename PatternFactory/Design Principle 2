Dependency Inversion Principle:-
Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

*High level* component is a class with behaviour defined in terms of other, *low level* components.
For eg, Pizza store is a high level component because its behaviour is defined in terms of Pizza - It creates
all the different pizza objects , prepares, bakes, cuts and boxes them, while the pizzas it uses are low level components
