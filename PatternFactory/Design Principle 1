We code to interfaces, when we dont know which implementation can be pursued. Only at runtime we will get to know
about it. At that time we encapsulate what varies.

Usually it is done by creating factory classes. It is either done statically (using static factory method) or the other
generic way. But the problem is you cant subclass static methods

Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
